Install Master: [NOTE: this steps are for v2015.8.0]

    $ cd <to your prefered directory>
    $ curl -L https://bootstrap.saltstack.com -o install_salt.sh
    $ sudo sh install_salt.sh -P -M git v2015.8.0
    
    If internet connection is proper and there will be no disturbances.
    Then the Salt mastr , minion and some salt master related tools will be 
    installed in your system.
    
Configure Master daemon: 
    for pur dev infrastructure we will do the following chnages
    
    file: /etc/salt/master
    changes:
        - search for "file_recv: False" and change it to "file_recv: True"
        - search for "file_roots" and uncomment the following lines
                 file_roots:
                    base:
                        - /srv/salt
        - search for "pillar_roots" and uncomment the following lines
                 pillar_roots:
                    base:
                        - /srv/pillar
    
    NOTE: for working the above configuration properly, run the bellow command
    which will create the directories.
    
        $ sudo mkdir -p /srv/{salt,pillar}

Configure Minion daemon: 
    for pur dev infrastructure we will do the following chnages
    
    file: /etc/salt/minion
    chnages:
        - though both master and minion daemons are running in the same server,
          search for "master: " and change it to "master: 127.0.0.1"
        
Check for configuration:
    Now the salt Master and Minion are configured in the same server, 
    it time to test by restarting the services.
    
    $ sudo restart salt-master
    $ sudo restart salt-minion
    
    #Step: 1
    By this process the salt master should capter the minion's key for secure 
    communication. to check this, run the following command to show the list 
    of accepted keys.
    
    $ sudo salt-key  --list all
    
    #Step: 2
    If everything works fine in step 1, the following output will display:
        student@master:~/v2015.8.0$ sudo salt-key  --list all
            Accepted Keys:
            Denied Keys:
            Unaccepted Keys:
            master
            Rejected Keys:
        
        NOTE 1: though the minion is running the master and the server hostname 
        is master, it is display as master in "unaccepted keys" list. which says,
        configuration is fine.
        
        NOTE 2: here in the display "master" is not a generic name, its "host name" 
        of the machine. in your implementation, it will the different based on the 
        server hostname, that you are using.
    
    To add the key, run the following command in master.
    
    $ sudo salt-key -a master
        NOTE: select 'Y' once prompted in the screen
    
    #step: 3 
    after successful execution of above command, run the following command to check 
    the minion key status
    
    $ sudo salt-key --list all
    Accepted Keys:
    master
    Denied Keys:
    Unaccepted Keys:
    Rejected Keys:
    
    NOTE: position of the master will be unter, Accepted Keys. :)
    
    #step: 4
    Ping test
    
    $ sudo salt '*' test.ping
    
    output:
    
        master:
            True
